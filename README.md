# leap-motion-gesture-recognition
 
A quick unity project to allow for the detection of specific gestures for the leap motion. 

To save a new gesure ensure that the "save gesture" box is ticked in the gesture recognition gameobject and press space. 
You can change the tolerance of the system by changing the tolerance float in the gesture recognition gameobject.
